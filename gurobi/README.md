### Python I: Introduction to Modeling with Python

This 55 minute video, part one of a three-part series, presents an introduction to using Python, Gurobi and Jupyter Notebooks. It covers the basics of model-building, including working with decision variables, constraints, objective function, sums and for-all loops.

### Python II: Advanced Algebraic Modeling with Python and Gurobi

This one-hour video, part two of a three-part series, covers more advanced topics including data structures and loops, sum and for-all expressions, working with large data sets and building large-scale, high-performance applications using the Gurobi Python interface.

### Python III: Optimization and Heuristics

This one-hour video, part three of a three-part series, covers one capability of MIP that is often overlooked: its ability to find and subsequently improve good quality solutions to exceedingly difficult problems. This webinar, which builds on the ideas presented in the last Python webinar, will focus on techniques for using the Gurobi MIP solver as a heuristic.
