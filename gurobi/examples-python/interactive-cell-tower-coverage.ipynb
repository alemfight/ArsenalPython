    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A cell tower is a site where antennae and electronic equipment for communications are placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a telecom company needs to build a set of cell towers to provide signal for inhabitants on Cape Cod. A number of potential locations for building the towers have been determined. The choice of these locations is based on several factors, including how well the tower blends in to the surrounding environment and the height of the terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "塔覆盖的范围有限，建筑预算有限。\n",
    "\n",
    "The towers have a fixed range, and due to budget constraints only a limited number of them can be built. Given these restrictions, the company wishes to provide coverage to as large a fraction of the population as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the problem, the company has split the area it wishes to cover into a set of regions, each of which has a known population.\n",
    "\n",

    "The goal is then to choose at which of the potential locations the company should build cell towers to provide coverage to as many people as possible.\n"
